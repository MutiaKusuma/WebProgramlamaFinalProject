This project is the Web Programming Course Final Project for the 2025-2026 Fall Semester.

The main goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive Fitness Center Management and Appointment System using ASP.NET Core MVC to apply the theoretical and practical knowledge gained in the course to a real-world problem.
The system is designed to manage various aspects of a sports facility, including:
- Service and Coach Management: Defining gym services, managing trainers (coaches), and their specialties.
- Member Appointment System: Allowing members to book appointments based on available coaches and services
- AI Integration: Incorporating an artificial intelligence feature to provide personalized exercise or diet plan suggestions based on user input (photos, body type, weight, etc.).

The overall aim is to enhance both the efficiency of the trainers and the personalized sports experience for the members. The project also requires the use of a REST API for database communication and reporting.
